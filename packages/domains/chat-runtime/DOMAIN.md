# Computer-owned chat

Computer-local storage for chat content, scoped to the authenticated hub. The hub
retains task and routing metadata; it is not a fallback content store.

Conversations have storage IDs independent of provider session IDs. Every write
checks a durable ownership epoch and state. Frozen sources refuse writes; staged
migrations require a verified manifest and explicit ownership activation. Deleted
conversations retain tombstones so late commands cannot recreate their history.

SQLite stores ordered JSON events, content records, and durable operation receipts.
A receipt means an operation was accepted, not that a provider received it. Provider
transcripts remain provider-managed. Existing hub backups and separately created
hub task artifacts are outside the live-chat storage boundary.

Task/provider settings have one computer authority and monotonic revisions;
per-tab caches and historical session replay cannot overwrite newer settings.
Every retained user attachment reference owns a verified pin. Tool payloads are
opaque and never interpreted as attachment references.

Queue admission reserves durable order before asynchronous attachment transfer.
Later messages can be acknowledged behind the pending head; cancellation,
deletion and restart fence late completions. Side-question results are transient;
their receipts prevent duplicate provider calls without retaining answer text.

First creation reserves hub metadata before bootstrap and activates only after
the computer acknowledges durable storage. Missing committed history is isolated
as unavailable; recovery never fabricates empty replacement history.

## Decisions

- 2026-11-02: Dedicated per-hub SQLite schema, WAL and synchronous FULL. No hub
  schema import; local storage failures surface instead of creating hub copies.
- 2026-11-02: Keep existing terminal runtime exports while adding independent
  transport, conversation-registry, and queue instances for computer composition.
