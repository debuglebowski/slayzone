# Computer-owned chat

Computer-local storage for chat content, scoped to the authenticated hub. The hub
retains task and routing metadata; it is not a fallback content store.

Conversations have storage IDs independent of provider session IDs. Every write
checks a durable ownership epoch and state. Frozen sources refuse writes; staged
migrations require a verified manifest and explicit ownership activation. Deleted
conversations retain tombstones so late commands cannot recreate their history.

SQLite stores ordered JSON events, content records, and durable operation receipts.
A receipt means an operation was accepted, not that a provider received it. Provider
transcripts remain provider-managed. Existing hub backups and separately created
hub task artifacts are outside the live-chat storage boundary.

## Decisions

- 2026-11-02: Dedicated per-hub SQLite schema, WAL and synchronous FULL. No hub
  schema import; local storage failures surface instead of creating hub copies.
- 2026-11-02: Keep existing terminal runtime exports while adding independent
  transport, conversation-registry, and queue instances for computer composition.
